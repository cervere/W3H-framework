Systemic view of brain modeling

This is a framework, under development, for an attempt to model different memory systems in brain, whose interaction results in key behavioral repertoire of an animal. 

The framework describes the interactions between several sensori-motor loops corresponding to different aspects of the external environment in which the animal survives.  [[1]](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01246653/)
