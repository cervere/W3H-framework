Systemic view of brain modelling

This is a framework, under development, for an attempt to model different memory systems in brain, whose interaction results in key behavioural repertoire of an animal.

The framework describes the interactions between several sensori-motor loops corresponding to different aspects of the external environment in which the animal survives.  [[1]](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01246653/)

## (Not so precise) Abstract :
This research statement is inspired from the idea of 'Survival of an animal in an external world'. At a fundamental level, an animal constantly interacts with various stimuli in its environment. These stimuli vary in time, in their characteristics, and in their outcomes when the animal interacts with them. Essentially, this variation results in different types of uncertainty in the animal's comprehension of the environment. Hence, the wide range of animal's behavioural repertoire to interact with such an environment emerges from its internal states and needs, estimating the uncertainty in the environment, and continuously  learning from the outcomes of its actions.
The aforementioned phenomenon involving the animal's perception, action and learning in the external environment is carried out by several sensory and motor information flows of the brain+body system. Depending on the context/situation, animal's behaviour emerges from either a conditioned response (which is an appetitive or an aversive response triggered from a previously learned association to a certain stimulus), or a goal-directed motivation that involves planning a certain task and more generally from the continuous learning that reinforces the animal's choices. There is a plenty of research in neuroscience explaining the above mentioned processes, but most often in an individual account of each specific process.
Hence, the attempt is to come up with a framework that helps integrate this knowledge of different sensori-motor loops and their functioning. Such an integrated representation requires finer definitions of animal's state in the environment, its internal needs, action contingencies depending on its evaluation of the state (using anticipation, desirability and internal motivation etc.).
Far from a neuronal level implementation, given the complexity of the brain structures and variables involved, we choose to begin with an algorithmic approach using the existing functional knowledge about these sensori-motor loops. We choose a simple task where an agent has to explore  the environment and exploit the available stimuli that suit the demands of its internal state. We use Malmo,  an experimentation platform by Microsoft, based on the Minecraft game, to design this simple world and further study the behavior of the agent emerging from the framework.
At a later point, the idea is to make it possible to integrate the existing detailed neuronal implementations of the individual pathways, wherever available. (For e.g, Some parts of Carrere et al model for Amygdala, VTA and Topalidau's model of action selection and habit formation would be a great start)
