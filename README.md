Systemic view of brain modelling

This is a framework, under development, for an attempt to model different memory systems in brain, whose interaction results in key behavioural repertoire of an animal.

The framework describes the interactions between several sensori-motor loops corresponding to different aspects of the external environment in which the animal survives.  [[1]](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01246653/)

## (Not so precise) Abstract :
This research statement is inspired from the idea of 'Survival of an animal in an external world'. At a fundamental level, an animal constantly interacts with various stimuli in its environment. These stimuli vary in time, in their characteristics, and in their outcomes when the animal interacts with them. Essentially, this variation results in different types of uncertainty in the animal's comprehension of the environment. Hence, the wide range of animal's behavioural repertoire to interact with such an environment emerges from its internal states and needs, estimating the uncertainty in the environment, and continuously  learning from the outcomes of its actions.
The aforementioned phenomenon involving the animal's perception, action and learning in the external environment is carried out by several sensory and motor information flows of the brain+body system. Depending on the context/situation, animal's behaviour emerges from either a conditioned response (which is appetitive or aversive response triggered from a previous learned association to a certain stimulus), or a goal-directed motivation that involves planning a certain task and generally from the learning
