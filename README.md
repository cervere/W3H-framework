# W3H-framework
Systemic view of brain modeling

This is a framework, under development, for an attempt to model sevaral memory systems in brain, whose interaction results in key behavioral repertoire of an animal. 

The attempt is to model a framework which describes the interactions between several sensori-motor loops corresponding to different aspects of the external environment in which the animal survives.  [1](#references)
